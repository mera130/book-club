    <h2>here's all buzz about bees</h2>
    <p>Honey bees <strong>Honey bees (Apis species)</strong>(Apis species) are among the most important pollinators in
        the world, playing a crucial role in ecosystems
        and agriculture. A typical honey bee colony consists of three types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones.
        The
        queen is the sole fertile female in the hive and can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. Worker bees, which are
        sterile
        females, perform all the essential tasks such as foraging, building the hive, feeding larvae, and protecting the
        colony.
        Male drones exist only to mate with a queen, and they die shortly after mating. If they do not mate, worker bees
        often
        expel them from the hive before winter.</p>

    <h2>why are they important</h2>
    <p><em>Honey bees are best known for their ability to produce honey.</em> They collect nectar from flowers using
        their long tongues
        and store it in their honey stomachs. Once back at the hive, they pass the nectar to other bees, who break it
        down into
        simple sugars and evaporate excess water by fanning it with their wings, eventually turning it into honey. This
        honey
        serves as a food source for the colony, especially during colder months when foraging is not possible.</p>
